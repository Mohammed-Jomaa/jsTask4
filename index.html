    <p>`Axios` is a library for HTTP requests. It's easy to use, can automatically handle JSON, and has useful features like intercepting requests and setting timeouts. It also throws errors for bad HTTP statuses (like 404 or 500).

        `fetch` is a native browser function for making requests. It's simpler but requires more code for common tasks, like handling JSON. `fetch` doesn't reject on HTTP errors unless there's a network issue. It doesn't have built-in timeouts or interceptors.
        
        `Axios` works in older browsers, while `fetch` might not. Your choice depends on your project's needs, like ease of use or browser support.
